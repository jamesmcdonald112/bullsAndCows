# Bulls and Cows Game

## Introduction
The Bulls and Cows game is a classic code-breaking game and it was guided by Hyperskill. The objective is to guess the secret code generated by the computer. 
The game provides feedback for each guess in the form of "bulls" and "cows." A "bull" indicates a correct digit in the correct position, while a "cow" indicates a correct digit in the wrong position.

## Project Structure
The project is organised into several packages, each with specific responsibilities:

- game: Contains the main game logic.
  - Game: Main class that drives the game logic, handles user input, and provides feedback.
- input: Handles user input.
  - InputHandler: Manages all user inputs, including prompts for code length, number of symbols, and user guesses.
- util: Provides utility classes for configuration, validation, code generation, and output formatting.
  - ConfigUtil: Loads and provides configuration properties.
  - CodeGenerator: Generates a valid secret code.
  - OutputUtil: Generates output messages for the game.
  - ValidationUtil: Validates user inputs, such as password length and number of symbols.
- exception: Custom exceptions for validation errors.
  - InvalidNumberOfSymbolsException: Thrown when the number of symbols is invalid.
  - InvalidPasswordLengthException: Thrown when the password length is invalid.

## Running the Game
To run the game:

```bash
javac src/BullsCowsGame.java
```
```bash
java BullsCowsGame
```

The game will prompt you to enter the length of the password and the number of possible symbols. It will then generate a secret code and allow you to make guesses until you successfully break the code.

## Example
```bash
Enter the length of the password:
0
Error: Invalid password length: 0. Must be between 1 and 36.
Enter the length of the password:
37
Enter the length of the password:
Error: Invalid password length: 37. Must be between 1 and 36.
4
Input the number of possible symbols in the code: 
1
Error: Number of symbols cannot be less than the password length.
Input the number of possible symbols in the code: 
37
Error: Number of symbols cannot be greater than 36.
Input the number of possible symbols in the code: 
5
The secret code is prepared: **** (0-9)).
Okay, let's start the game!

Congratulations! You guessed the secret code: 4023
```

## Conclusion
This project brought together various aspects of software development, including input handling, validation, exception handling, and modular design. 
By the end of the project, I felt much more comfortable with the process of planning and organising a project before even writing a single line of code. 
It raised important questions about the importance of project planning, imagining classes and packages, and focusing on creating a good working application before refining it. 
Overall, it was a rewarding experience that enhanced my programming skills and project management abilities.
